<p>Visualization, at its heart, is about insight and storytelling, <em>not</em> <a href="http://dataviz.tools">tools</a>. But ask most anyone who's ever worked with me what I think of one particular tool called <a href="http://public.tableau.com">Tableau Public</a>, and they'll quickly tell you it is a tool I'm quick to criticize. I don't like its proprietary, closed-source model, its lack of adherence to web standards or its lack of support for full responsiveness.</p>

<p>But, if we really get back to what the fundamental essence of data visualization is, it shouldn't matter so much what <em>tools</em> we use so much as it does what <em>visual insight</em> we glean and how <em>accessible</em> that insight is to the intended audience.</p> 

In my defense, my high-level data viz snobbery of vendor lock-in and freemium tools such as Tableau has frequently been on-point, especially when it comes to <em>accessibility</em> of visual insights to users of <em>all</em> devices. Up until its latest version, Tableau offered virtually <a href="https://cmtoomey.github.io/responsive/2015/11/18/responsiveresponse.html">no configuration whatsoever even to build adaptive visualizations</a>, much less visualizations that could be remotely considered responsive (<a href="https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/8/tips-designing-device-specific-dashboards-make-everyone-happy-57548">"device-specific dashboards"</a> is the marketing lingo Tableau touted upon its latest release, which means the visualization designer had to create separate dashboards for different device sizes). So, in that sense, at least, my begrudgery of Tableau was warranted. Right? Let's keep in mind quotation from the legendary Ben Schneiderman Bostock mentions at the beginning of his talk:

> "The purpose of visualization is insight, not pictures." -Ben Schneiderman

Sure, on the surface, Bostock's comments can be taken as the now cliche Tufte-esque quip for higher "data-to-ink" ratios and less decorative embellishments. I'm afraid, however, that wasn't the point Bostock was making.

Let's keep in mind Mike Bostock's words-of-wisdom in his keynote on <a href="http://d3.express">d3.express,</a> a notebook-style interface for d3.js programming: 

> Code is about empowering.



Remember, he was annoucing d3.express, a new 

> Code has come a long way, but it's still far from human-friendly. -Mike Bostock

visualization is itself a tool -- don't wish to downplay but 

Still a need for open-source, code-driven – more than ever before –

> Code is often the best tool we have because it is the most general tool. -Bostock
