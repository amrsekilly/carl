<p>Visualization, at its heart, is about insight and storytelling, not tools. But ask most anyone who's ever worked with me what I think of <a href="http://public.tableau.com">Tableau Public</a>, and they'll quickly tell you it is a tool I publicly have criticized because of its proprietary nature and its lack of adherence to web standards and its lack of support for full responsiveness.</p>
