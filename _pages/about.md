> Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.
> -Melvin Kranzenberg


I'm a twenty-something interactive web developer, computational data designer, civic technologist, data journalist and digital educator. I believe democracy is at its strongest when it has an informed and engaged citizenry, and it is incumbent upon both the private sector and the public sector to ensure the information needs of communities are met in the twenty-first century in an independent and fact-fueled manner.

For most of my career, I've worked in mid-sized newsrooms as a "digital person." That's a vague way of saying that I've taken on projects as complex as scraping public data from government databases using Python and visualizing that data in d3.js, and as myriad as delivering workshops to veteran journalists on the use of social media as a reporting tool.
